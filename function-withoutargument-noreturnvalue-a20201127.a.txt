Algorithm:
1. Start
2. I have used function with no argument and no return value
3. Declared a function called add
4. Function has been called (add)
5. Inside the function definition statements have been entered
* Declared a variable (num)
* Address was stored in the memory
* Conditional statement was applied 
* If it is true, given number is even
* Else the given number is odd
    6.Stop


Coding:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void add (void);
void main ()
         {
           add ();
         }
         void add (void)
            {
                    int num;
                    printf ("enter the number");
                    scanf ("%d", &num);
                    if (num %2 == 0)
                         {
                            printf("%d is even",num);
                         }
                            else
                               {
                                   printf ("%d is odd",num);
                               }
                    
            }
